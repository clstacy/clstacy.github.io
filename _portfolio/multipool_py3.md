Feel free to use my updated [Python 3 implementation of MULTIPOOL](https://github.com/clstacy/multipool), designed for efficient Bulk Segregant Analysis (BSA). This modernized tool provides a robust solution for mapping genetic traits, offering the availability of a powerful tool to be used in Python 3.
