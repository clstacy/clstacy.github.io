Available [here](https://clstacy.github.io/GenomicDataAnalysis) is a course I co-developed with my graduate advisor, Dr. Jeffrey Lewis. In this project, I created engaging class exercises and activities for an introductory course on Genomic Data Analysis, combining theoretical insights with practical, hands-on bioinformatics exercises.
