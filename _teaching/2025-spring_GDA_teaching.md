As a Teaching Assistant for the **Genomic Data Analysis Course**, I support an advanced graduate curriculum that I co-developed with my graduate advisor in 2023. This course integrates theoretical insights with practical applications in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, empowering students to tackle complex genomic datasets with confidence.

**Key Responsibilities:**
======

- **Laboratory and Computational Facilitation:** Oversee hands-on sessions that integrate computational tools (e.g., R and Python) and statistical methods to analyze real genomic datasets.
- **Instructional Support:** Deliver focused mini-lectures and facilitate interactive discussions, clarifying complex concepts and fostering an engaging learning environment.
- **Course Material Preparation:** Assist in the preparation and refinement of course materials, including interactive modules, coding exercises, and supplementary resources.

**Teaching Approach:**
=====
I employ a student-centered approach that encourages critical thinking and active learning. By blending traditional lectures with real-time coding exercises and problem-based learning, I help students bridge theory with practice in the realm of genomic data analysis.

**Notable Achievements:**
=====
- **Curriculum Co-Development:** Played a key role in designing a cutting-edge curriculum that seamlessly integrates theory and hands-on data analysis.
- **Innovative Learning Tools:** Contributed to the development of interactive modules and coding exercises that enhance understanding and application of genomic analysis techniques.
- **Positive Student Feedback:** Consistently received high evaluations, reflecting my commitment to clarity, academic rigor, and supportive instruction.

**Collaboration and Feedback:**
=====
I work closely with the course instructors to ensure the curriculum stays current and responsive to student needs. My proactive engagement in gathering and implementing feedback has helped create a dynamic and effective learning environment for graduate students.

My role in this course is both challenging and rewarding, reinforcing my commitment to excellence in teaching and to the advancement of genomic data analysis education.
