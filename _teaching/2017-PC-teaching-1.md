As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Liberia, I had the rewarding experience of teaching high school chemistry. During my service, I developed and implemented a comprehensive chemistry curriculum tailored to the needs of my students, who were eager to learn despite the challenging circumstances. My approach was hands-on and interactive, emphasizing practical experiments and real-world applications of chemical principles.

Key Responsibilities:
======
- Chemistry Instruction: Designed and delivered engaging student-centered lesson plans that made complex topics accessible and exciting for students.
- Laboratory Skills: Conducted laboratory sessions to provide students with practical experience and enhance their understanding of theoretical concepts.
- Student Support: Offered after-school tutoring and mentoring to support students' academic growth and foster a love for science.

Gender Equality Advocacy:
======

In addition to my teaching duties, I was deeply involved in gender equality advocacy. I worked on initiatives aimed at empowering young girls and promoting equal opportunities in education. This included organizing workshops and discussion groups to address gender stereotypes and encourage female students to pursue STEM subjects.
Teacher Training Workshops:

Recognizing the need for professional development among my fellow educators, I co-led a series of teacher training workshops. These sessions focused on:

- Pedagogical Strategies: Sharing effective teaching methodologies and classroom management techniques.
- Curriculum Development: Assisting teachers in creating dynamic and inclusive lesson plans.
- Resource Utilization: Demonstrating how to make the best use of limited resources to enhance the learning experience.

My time in Liberia was transformative, both for my students and for myself. It reinforced my commitment to education and advocacy, shaping my approach to teaching and community engagement.
