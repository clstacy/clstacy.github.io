During my sophomore through senior years of college, I served as a Supplemental Instruction (SI) Leader for General Chemistry II, Honors General Chemistry II, and Fundamentals of Chemistry. This role allowed me to support students in mastering challenging chemistry concepts through collaborative learning sessions.

Key Responsibilities:
====== 
- Session Planning and Facilitation: Designed and led interactive study sessions that reinforced course content and promoted active learning. These sessions included problem-solving activities, group discussions, and review exercises.
- Student Support: Provided one-on-one assistance to students, helping them understand difficult concepts and improve their study strategies.
- Resource Development: Created supplemental materials such as practice exams, worksheets, and study guides to aid students in their preparation for exams and quizzes.
- Assessment and Feedback: Collected and analyzed feedback from students to continuously improve the effectiveness of SI sessions. Adjusted session content and methods based on student needs and performance.

Teaching Approach:
====== 
I employed a collaborative and student-centered approach, encouraging peer-to-peer interaction and fostering a supportive learning environment. My goal was to help students develop critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of chemistry through active participation.

Notable Achievements:
====== 
- SI Leader Peer Mentor: I was the first SI leader in the program history to have served as the SI team leader for my course of instruction for two years. In this position, I observed my peers facilitating their sessions and provided support and constructive ideas for improvement.
- Improved Student Performance: Consistently observed significant improvements in student performance and understanding as a result of the SI sessions. Many students reported increased confidence and better grades.
- High Attendance Rates: Achieved high attendance rates in SI sessions, indicating the value and effectiveness of the support provided.
- Positive Student Feedback: Received positive feedback from students, who appreciated the engaging and supportive nature of the sessions.

Challenges and Solutions:
====== 
One of the challenges I faced was addressing the diverse needs and learning styles of students. To overcome this, I employed a variety of teaching techniques and resources, ensuring that each student could benefit from the sessions regardless of their preferred learning style.
Collaboration and Professional Development:

Worked closely with course instructors to align SI sessions with the course curriculum and objectives. Participated in regular training and professional development sessions to enhance my teaching skills and stay updated on best practices in supplemental instruction.

My experience as an SI Leader was instrumental in developing my teaching skills and deepening my understanding of chemistry. This role laid the foundation for my future teaching endeavors, including my service as a Peace Corps Volunteer and my subsequent roles in education.
