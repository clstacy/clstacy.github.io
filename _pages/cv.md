- **Big Data Management:** Analyzed 200+ RNA-seq samples using a reproducible Nextflow pipeline; improved gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) visualizations with a custom R package; utilized regularized regression to identify phenotype-associated genes.  
- **Educational Impact:** Served as a Teaching Assistant for five semesters (avg. student evaluation score of 4.8/5). Co-designed an interactive Genomic Data Analysis course, boosting student learning outcomes.

### **Laboratory Technician**  
**Ceballos Lab, University of Arkansas – Fayetteville, AR**  
*August 2019 – January 2020*  
- **Model Development:** Applied weighted phenotype analysis to quantify virus-induced changes in neuronal signaling, leading to two co-authored research publications.  
- **Process Optimization:** Authored and maintained a comprehensive SOP for FPLC operations, streamlining ion exchange and size exclusion protocols.  
- **Innovation:** Developed a neuron-tracing algorithm for detecting changes in signaling kinetics post-viral infection.

### **High School Chemistry Teacher (Peace Corps Volunteer)**  
**Kolahun, Lofa County, Liberia**  
*May 2017 – October 2018*  
- **Curriculum Development:** Designed culturally responsive STEM curricula for grades 10–12, engaging 1,200+ students in interactive lab activities.  
- **Capacity Building:** Organized teacher training workshops to foster modern pedagogical strategies, serving as the only chemistry teacher in town.  
- **Community Engagement:** Co-led the Girls Club of Kolahun, encouraging science education and community involvement.

### **Supplemental Instruction Leader (Chemistry)**  
**CLASS+, University of Arkansas – Fayetteville, AR**  
*January 2014 – May 2017*  
- **Instructional Excellence:** Guided small-group tutoring sessions and interactive drills to enhance first-year chemistry comprehension.
