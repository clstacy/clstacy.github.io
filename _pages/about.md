## About Me

Hello! I’m **Carson Stacy**, a Ph.D. candidate in Cell & Molecular Biology and an M.S. student in Statistics at the University of Arkansas. I’m fascinated by the intersection of **biology** and **statistics**—particularly in how advanced modeling techniques can accelerate discoveries in genomics and molecular biology.

Through my doctoral research, I’ve explored genomic determinants of stress tolerance using CRISPR screens and high-throughput RNA-seq studies. My passion for **data analysis** and **reproducible science** drives me to build reproducible workflows—from Nextflow pipelines to custom R packages for visualization, that uncover new insights from complex datasets.

Beyond my research, I’m dedicated to **teaching** and **mentorship**. I’ve designed interactive assignments, co-led a Genomic Data Analysis course, and developed several open-source tools that help both my peers and students learn more effectively.
