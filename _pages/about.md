Welcome to my corner of the internet. I like solving challenging problems at the nexus and biology and big data.

Check out some of my more recent work
======
A searchable database of doubling times of haploid lab yeast knock-out strains is available [here](https://clstacy.github.io/yeastKODoublingTimes/). 

Feel free to check out my updated Python 3 implementation of the MULTIPOOL mapping software [here](https://github.com/clstacy/multipool) for BSA analyses.

If you are as geese-averse as myself, you might appreciate [this satirical class project](https://clstacy.github.io/SciComp4Bio_Fa22/). 

This page is a work in progress...
